# Flipkart-Scrapper-Heroku
This is a Web Scrapper built using Python and Flask Framework. It scraps Flipkart's website and shows all the user names, reviews, ratings, and descriptions given by that user. The front end part consists of HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Javascript while the Flask Framework controls the back-end part.

This program can scrap the entire product list shown on Flipkart's Site. But it is limited to 2 products due to timeout issue on Heroku.

This program is deployed in Heroku Platform.
